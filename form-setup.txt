form-setup



for form setup we have to apply a plugin, form control 7,
then a contact option will generate in the wordpress dashboard,
there copy the form content and do changes from the contact  form options, and remove all whitespaces also,
after saving, a short code will generate, use the code in html , in a php code.

<?php echo do_shortcode('[contact-form-7 id="232" title="Contact form 1"]'); ?>


*note: every form options have a specific id no. if input type bocomes same, then have to change id no.
